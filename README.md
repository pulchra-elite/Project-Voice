# VoiceNote

In this project, we developed a note-taking app that allows users to take notes with voice inputs. After singup, users could save new notes and view all the previous notes and its corresponding recordings. We also provided text understanding features including sentiment analysis, Named-entity recognition (NER), and content classification to let users analyze their notes. 

We built the web application using MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), Passport.js, Bootstrap, Web Speech API, MediaRecorder API, Google Natural Language API, and AWS S3.
